Welcome to your DIB-lab rotation project! 
All resources needed to learn a metagenomics workflow are contained within this repository. 
If you see a mistake or something is not clear, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/taylorreiter/dib_rotation/issues). 

During this rotation, you will learn how to:
 + interact with an HPC (we'll use [Farm](https://www.hpc.ucdavis.edu/posts/about_farm/))
 + install and manage software environments using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
 + download sequencing data and other files from the internet and public databases
 + interpret and use different file formats in bioinformatics and computing
 + quality analysis and control for sequencing data
 + determine the taxonomic composition of sequencing reads
 + assemble and annotate metagenomic reads
 + quickly compare large sequencing datasets
 + how to document workflows using git and GitHub. 
 
The files in this repository are ordered by execution, meaning file `00*` should be completed before `01*`. 

Most of the work done in this rotation will be completed on Farm. 
However, you will need to access Farm from your own computer. 
We will use an SSH-client to be able to interact with Farm. 
If you are using a Mac or a Linux, your computer comes with a program called `Terminal` that we will use as an SSH-client.
If you are on a Windows running Windows 10, you can install the [Ubuntu Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
Otherwise, please follow the instructions for Windows found at this [link](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-intro/setup/).
