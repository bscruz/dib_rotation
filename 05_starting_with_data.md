We will be working with a metagenome sample from an Alaskan Oil Reservoir sequenced in [this study](https://mbio.asm.org/content/7/1/e01669-15).
The sample is named SB1 because it was sampled from the Schrader Bluff Formation.

We will start working with this sample by downloading it. 
Then, we will assess its quality using FastQC. 

There are many ways to discover and download sequencing data. 
In this case, we are using a sample that was detailed in a paper.
