# DIB Lab Metagenomics Rotation Project


Welcome to the project home for our DIB-lab rotation materials!  The [training website](dib-lab.github.io/dib_rotation/) contains a much prettier (rendered) version of these materials - check it out!

The material in this repository covers a metagenomics workflow.
It incorporates bioinformatics skills like unix, documenting workflows, and using a remote computer. 
It covers the use of tools like sourmash and spacegraphcats. 

The material in this repository is adapted from the following sources:
