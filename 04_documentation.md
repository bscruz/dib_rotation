Just like with wetlab work, it's important to document everything you do during a computational workflow. 
It's ok to provide the minimum amount of information necessary to execute a set of commands (i.e., you don't necessary have to record every failure, every `ls`, etc), but it is important to document each step.
Any kind of documentation that works for you is an acceptable form, but we've found a few that are harder and a few that are easier:
+ Using google docs or Microsoft Word for documenting computer commands can be hard because of autocorrection. 
We generally recommend against using these programs.
+ Using a plain text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Atom, BBEdit, TextEdit, nano, vim) avoids autocorrect problems but still has a nice user interface.
+ Copying and pasting the commands that worked is a great way to record them (the `history` command can be helpful to see what you've run in the past).

Eventually, we'll work through using git and GitHub to record and version control our workflows, but for now it's enough to write down everything you do.
