High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to computers that have more capability than a typical personal computer 
(i.e. most desktops and laptops). 
Many research problems we encounter when analyzing sequencing data require more resources than we have available on our laptops.
For this, we use large, remote compute systems that have more resources available. 

Most univeristies have access to an HPC (or cluster) that has a large amount of hard drive space to store files, RAM for computing tasks, and CPUs for processing.
Other options for accessing large computers include NSF XSEDE services like Jetstream and paid services like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud.
We will use the UC Davis [Farm](https://wiki.cse.ucdavis.edu/support/systems/farm) Cluster during this rotation.
